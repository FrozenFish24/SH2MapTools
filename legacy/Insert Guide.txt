1. Configure SCALE and TRANSLATION constants in SH2MapRip.py and convert_to_sh2.py
2. Dump map Geometry with SH2MapRip.py, note down the vertex and IB offsets for the object after the one being modified
3. Note object and primitive to modify
4. Make modifications ensuring vertices have only one set of UV coords (see below for Blender instructions)
5. Export to obj (triangulate, no materials)
6. Run convert_to_sh2.py on exported obj producing a corrected obj and index list
7. Feed index list to NvTriStrip (args: -s -cs 4096) producing an index list for a tri strip
8. Configure the starting index where the new strip will be inserted and number of vertices
9. Provide produced index list and a copy of the original index buffer to ibuf_fixer.py
10. Provide the updated obj file produced in step 6 to vertexPacker.py, producing the vert data in binary form
11. Update map_helper.py with the object and primitive index (determined in step 2) being edited
12. Update map_helper.py with the amount of verts being added and the size of the binary in bytes
13. Update map_helper.py with the size of the original and modified index buffers
14. Run map_helper.py on the map file to update all size fields
15. With a hex editor open the map file, go to the vertex offset found in step two and insert new vert data
16. With a hex editor search for the first several bytes of the index buffer, and replace the whole thing with the new one

Blender:
1. Create or import model in Blender
2. In the UV editor do "Seams from Islands"
3. In 3D View select all seams and Edge Split
4. Export as obj
